HTML needs input element of some sort linked to check against a word

word displayed, blank, in box format [][][][][][][]

input will check against (loop through) all boxes and if it matches, reveals it

To pick the word, have a math random pick one of the words (probably all built as new elements w/ JS)


We can use the parts of our constructor element (new Words) to impact HTML elements
